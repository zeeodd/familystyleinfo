        <button class="collapsible"><span class="collapsible-header">01 — NEW YEAR, NEW FAMILY STYLE</span></button>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="date"><i>January 12, 2024</i></p>
          <p>Hey there, chefs— welcome to Co-op Kitchen’s development log! Why are we starting one? Well, Family Style started as a meager college project, and while our original team dreamed that it would explode in popularity, we were stunned when it actually did. We loved building up a player base, and this dev log is just one tool we want to use to communicate with all of you.</p>
          <img class="devlogImage" src="img/fs2/2024_Announcement_Discord_Fullsize.webp" alt="FS2 release banner">
          <p>We also just announced Family Style 2, and that’s no coincidence with us starting a dev log. You can expect teasers of things to come, struggles we’re (hopefully) overcoming, and a general behind-the-scenes look at our small team as we develop Family Style 2. </p>
          <p>Last week, we asked chefs across all our socials for questions they want us to answer in our inaugural issue. We got some really awesome questions, so thank you to everyone who threw their curiosity our way! Check out some of our answers below:</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Q: Is Family Style 2 an update/revamp to Family Style or is it a new/different game?</span></br>Family Style 2 will be a completely new game and separate app from the Family Style you know and love. While the sequel will maintain much of the core gameplay that gives this hectic cooking game its identity, there will also be a myriad of new features, visuals, and gameplay elements that will freshen up the experience.</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Q: When is it releasing?</span></br>Sometime near the end of 2024. We don’t have an exact release date… yet. Please follow us on any of our social platforms to stay up to date! <a href="https://discord.gg/QEuEMyU" target="_blank">Discord</a> | <a href="https://bit.ly/famstyTwitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://bit.ly/famstyInstagram" target="_blank">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://bit.ly/famstyFacebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> (shameless plug)</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Q: Will Family Style 2 have better support?</span></br>Absolutely yes. Family Style was built with software that simply could not scale the way we wanted. It has dependencies that have become obsolete and near impossible to manage. Due to additional external factors outside of our control, our ability to maintain and upkeep Family Style dwindled despite our desire to fix its issues. </br></br> However, we’re rebuilding <i>everything</i> from the ground up this time around! Art, codebase, device support, everything. Family Style 2 will have dedicated eyes on it to ensure all of its bugs get squashed as well. Maybe even additional features or modes post-launch. <i>Wait what— who said that?</i></p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Q: What are the new ingredients/recipes/cookwares?</span></br>We’re going to keep our lips pretty sealed on this for now… but we are going to be including bagels. Perhaps you noticed this delicious breakfast goodie in our teaser image!</p>
          <img class="devlogImage" src="img/fs2/GetRotatedBagel.gif" alt="Rotating bagel gif">
          <p><span class="highlight">Q: Can we submit puns for the loading screens between rounds?</span></br>This is a fantastic idea! Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/QEuEMyU" target="_blank">Discord</a> if you haven’t already, and we’ll probably host a little contest there in the future.</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">Q: The art looks new, what inspired the new look?</span></br>We’ll be deep diving into this in future dev logs. It really merits a whole issue, and our new artist would love to talk about this. Stay tuned!</p>
          <p></p>

        <!-- DEV LOG 02 -->
        <button class="collapsible"><span class="collapsible-header">02 — MAKING COOKING FUN</span></button>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="date"><i>February 16, 2024</i></p>
          <p>A big goal of Family Style 2 is to make cooking more meaningful. During the development of the original game, we had a similar lofty goal, but due to time constraints we ended up shipping with what you can experience today: a simple 6-tap interaction.</p>
          <img class="devlogImage" src="img/fs2/devlog/dl2_cookinggameplay.gif">
          <p class="caption"><i>Gameplay footage from Smiley_Builder on Youtube! Check them out :)</i></p>
          <p>What do we mean by meaningful though? Do we mean more fun? More interactive? Well, one of our design pillars is geared toward wringing out as much functionality and affordance as we can from the mobile platform. Having cooking equate to quick, subsequent taps just doesn’t… cut it for the sequel. We want to leverage mobile controls so that cooking feels more substantive and better matches the real-world action. This sounds more meaningful, right?</p>
          <p>We’ve been experimenting with a myriad of different ways to achieve this! Some minigames involve a little bit of patience as things cook, forcing you to interact when the moment is just right. Other minigames are more active and require more of your attention and focus. Some are a combination of both patience and action. Below are some mockups of the skillet and fryer minigames with which we’ve been toying. Expect more details about these in the future.</p>
          <img class="devlogImage" src="img/fs2/devlog/dl2_cookwareminigame_mockup.png">
          <p>The idea is to play on the tension that cooperative cooking can create, forcing the player to decide to split their focus between cooking, listening to teammates, and finishing their recipe. In the original game, this split focus worked wonders for creating chaos- and we want to lean more into that direction! By adding more engagement to cooking instead of just mindless tapping, we’re effectively adding another factor to split focus between. More chaos? You asked for it!</p>
          <p>This does beg the question though: what happens if you don’t cook “correctly”? If cooking is now more of a minigame than before, what happens if you “lose” and don’t properly cook the ingredient? Hm. Good question. Stay tuned :)</p>
